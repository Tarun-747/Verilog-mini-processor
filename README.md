## Project Description

The mini processor has a register file consisting of 16 registers, each of 8 bits. The processor can execute various instructions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logical operations. It also supports branching and data movement instructions. The design includes modular components such as the ALU, register file, and control unit, ensuring a clear and testable structure.

## Features

- **16 8-bit Registers**: Supports a wide range of operations with 16 general-purpose registers.
- **Instruction Set**: Implements a variety of instructions including arithmetic, logical, and control operations.
- **Modular Design**: Components like ALU, register file, and control unit are designed as separate modules.
- **FPGA Implementation**: Synthesized and tested on an FPGA for real-world validation.
- **Detailed Testbenches**: Comprehensive testing for each module and the overall processor.
